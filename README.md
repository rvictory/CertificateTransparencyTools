# CertificateTransparencyTools
Tools to work with Certificate Transparency Lists (per RFC 6962) in Ruby. Parses the binary Merkle Structures and has code to
parse out relevant certificate data from the structures. Working to output the same JSON format as Certstream (https://certstream.calidog.io/).
Will eventually also have code to download the entirety of logs for historical data analytics purposes.

This code is largely inspired by the Axeman tool at https://github.com/CaliDog/Axeman (thanks!)
